Manual testing is time consuming if a new feature is realeased, we have to test all the existing feature and the new feature

three types of tests:
Unit test: focus is on testing the individual building block of an app such as a class or a function or a component;
in unit testing, eac unit or building block is testing in isolation, independent of other tests. Run in a very short amount of time and make it very easy to pinpoint failures;

integration test:
focus is on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together


end to end test:
focus is on testing the entire app flow and ensuring it works as desgined from start to finsih.
Involves in a real Ui, a real backend db and services.
take the longest as they cover the most amount of code.

RTL strikes a balance between unit and E2E test
